# Integrating AdminLTE with .NET5 (or ASP.NET Core MVC 3.1)
We will learn how integrating AdminLTE with ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC or really any other Bootstrap based UI Frameworks completely from scratch. We will also go through about integrating Identity Server to our MVC Applicaiton. Also, you will gain quite a lot of practical knowledge on Views, Layouts, Partial Views, Conditional Rendering, Navigation Indicator and much more.

For more details about this project, you can read my post titled [Integrating AdminLTE with ASP.NET Core](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/net-core/integrating-adminlte-with-asp-net-core/) from my blog [PureSourceCode](https://www.puresourcecode.com)

> I updated the project to `.NET5`. You can use the same project with `.NET Core 3.1` if you downgrade the project from `.NET5` to `.NET Core 3.1` and the NuGet packages.
