# Integrating AdminLTE with ASP.NET Core 3.1
We will learn how integrating AdminLTE with ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC or really any other Bootstrap based UI Frameworks completely from scratch. We will also go through about integrating Identity Server to our MVC Applicaiton. Also, you will gain quite a lot of practical knowledge on Views, Layouts, Partial Views, Conditional Rendering, Navigation Indicator and much more.
